# Leachate Flow Analysis and Prediction System

## Leachate Management: Challenges and Characteristics in Municipal Landfills

**Leachate** is the liquid effluent generated by the leaching of municipal solid waste (MSW) in landfills located in large cities. Its treatment represents one of the greatest challenges in MSW management due to its chemical complexity and high pollutant load. The chemical characteristics of leachate can vary significantly depending on factors such as seasonality, landfill age, the type of waste deposited, and the operational and environmental conditions of the site.

In the case of a landfill located in southern Brazil, which receives approximately 5,000 tons of waste per day grouped into two main cells, the operation generates leachate at a flow rate of approximately 30 m³/h during the dry season and 60 m³/h in the rainy season. This corresponds to a daily volume ranging between 720 m³ and 1440 m³.

The leachate consists mainly of a mixture of **"old leachate"**, originating from older waste cells, and **"new leachate"**, derived from more recent waste cells. This mixture is characterized by its dark and turbid appearance and primarily contains total suspended solids (TSS), biodegradable organic matter (BOD), recalcitrant organic matter (COD), ammoniacal nitrogen (ammonium-N), and dissolved salts.

The **chemical oxygen demand (COD)** is predominantly composed of humic and fulvic substances, which are the result of the degradation of plant and organic material. These properties highlight the need for specific treatment strategies to effectively manage this complex effluent.

## Achievements in Leachate Management Analysis

1. **Analysis of Flow Rate Trends**: Conducted a detailed examination of the leachate flow rate over the last 600 days.
2. **Rainfall Trends Study**: Investigated precipitation patterns to understand their impact on leachate generation.
3. **Moving Averages Calculation**: Implemented moving averages to estimate the growth and scalability of the treatment system.
4. **Flow Rate Prediction**: Developed a simple neural network model to predict daily leachate flow rates.
